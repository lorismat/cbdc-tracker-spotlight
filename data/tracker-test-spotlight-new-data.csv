In 2016, the SDE accounted for less than 0.003% of currency in circulation.

In March 2021, IMF representative Sarah Zhou sounded a voice of caution on the SOV rollout and said that the issuance of the Marshall Islands’ digital sovereign currency as legal tender would “raise risks to macroeconomic and financial stability as well as financial integrity” of the islands, “resulting in a significant drag on the economy.” If issued, the SOV’s launch will be preceded by an 18-to-24-month Timed Release Monetary Issuance, or presale, to gauge liquidity and market interest.",,Retail,,Undecided,Undecided,Undecided,Algorand,,"https://decrypt.co/43979/inside-marshall-islands-new-cryptocurrency-sov

Project Aber was different from most pilot programs as two central banks and a further three commercial banks from each country were involved in the project. The high-level objectives of Aber were: to research DLT and to explore its suitability for such an experiment; to see whether inefficiencies of the existing cross-border payments could be overcome using a CBDC; as well as gaining knowledge and experience in DLT and the challenges of deploying a mutualized infrastructure. The project's conclusion in November 2020 confirmed that a cross-border dual issued currency was technically viable and that it was possible to design a distributed payment system that offers significant improvements over a centralized payment system. In February 2021, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates will join China, Hong Kong, and Thailand in a joint CBDC cross-border test.
